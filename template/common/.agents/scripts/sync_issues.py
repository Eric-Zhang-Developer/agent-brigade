"""Keep one GitHub issue per feature spec, and one GitHub milestone per milestone in specs/milestones.toml.

  sync_issues.py [--dry-run]

CI runs this on every push to main. For each specs/features/<slug>/spec.md:
  no issue with "<!-- spec: <slug> -->" in its body   create one, titled with the spec's name, labelled `feature`
  the spec's milestone changed                        move the issue to it (or off it, for the backlog)
  changes/<slug>.md exists (done)                     close the issue
Issues are matched by that hidden marker, never by title, so people can retitle them. The spec stays the source of
truth. Bodies and comments are never rewritten, and a closed issue is never reopened (a person may have closed it on
purpose). Each milestone with a ship time becomes a GitHub milestone with that due date. Also makes sure the labels
the workflow uses exist.
